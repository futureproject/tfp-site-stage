      <h4>Dream Teams</h4>
      <p>To multiply their impact, Dream Directors build Dream Teams of coaches, students, and teachers, and charge them with transforming their schools from the inside out. We believe young people must be leading school change.</p>

      <h4>Whole School Change</h4>
      <p>As students lead their peers, Dream Directors partner with principals to reimagine spaces, rethink policies, and remove any barrier in the way of inspiration. Within months, the school's new culture inspires everyone within it. </p>
