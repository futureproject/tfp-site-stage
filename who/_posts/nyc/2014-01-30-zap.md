Sarah is driven by the idea that every person has a wealth of unique gifts to offer. Before joining The Future Project, Sarah founded an organization that pairs recently immigrated high school students and college students studying foreign languages into a mutual-mentorship relationship in which they teach each other. As a Dream Director, she empowers everyone she meets to identify their brilliance, share it boldly with others and get curious about the world around them.
