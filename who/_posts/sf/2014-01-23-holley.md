A native of New York City, Holley’s a social entrepreneur and rhetoric coach who’s been using education, food and music as conduits for change since 2006. In 2011, she co-founded The Hall Pass Tour, a youth-powered concert and events company helping underserved secondary school students carve out higher learning paths that align with their dreams. Now based in the SF Bay Area, she’s excited to instigate even more change on the West Coast as the Dream Director at her high school.
