As our Director of Story, Dan spends his time on the ground in our cities and our schools, searching for (and hopefully finding) the best stories from the world of The Future Project and produces video, audio and written stories from them. After a stint in documentary film, he made his way over to TFP to start building the storytelling operation. For him, the best thing about that process is not knowing what he’ll find, who he’ll talk to, or what kinds of stories will come out of it. Luckily there are a ton of good stories there, just waiting to be found.
