Divine’s been a social entrepreneur ever since he was seventeen, when he turned his parents’ house in Brooklyn into a community center for other young people in the neighborhood. Ever since, he’s been dedicated to creating a new generation of leaders, a charge he’s taken to Malcolm X. Shabazz High School and the entire City of Newark.
