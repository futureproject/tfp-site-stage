Kathleen is the Executive Assistant to the co-founders, and she’s a whole lot more. A freelance web designer, a mother, and a brilliant get-things-doner who somehow manages to keep us all on track while working remotely from suburban Maryland. If we didn’t know any better, we’d assume she was too good to be true. Lucky for us, she’s both.
