Chris is an investor, philanthropist and inventor who builds crazy stealth vehicles and other never-before-dreamed-of products. He moonlights as a martial artist who fights crime outside the bounds of the law, dressed completely in black to blend seamlessly into the night. Although his penchant for vigilante justice has earned him the ire of the police, they still send up a signal into the sky every time he's desperately needed.

He also codes websites, and has built this one. A true master of all trades.
