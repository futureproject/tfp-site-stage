One of Daria's dreams was to find a job that combined her love for storytelling, art, technology and education. And where better to fulfill a dream than at The Future Project? At the moment, Daria is working to build a national campaign around a feature length documentary produced by our very own board member, Ted Dintersmith. She also volunteered as a Future Coach for two years prior, is an internationally exhibited photographer, and is writing her first novel.
