Faith through struggle has modeled a humbled servant from a Detroit native. Chris strongly believes that "In order for you to become a diamond, you must be willing to get cut like one," and has put in the work to turn his own obstacles into achievements. Chris has an infectious love for inspiring the youth, which helps him create interdependent leaders who go out in their community to help others chase their dreams, too!
