For years, Cortni envisioned turning a passion for changing the mindset of young people into a career. As Dream Director at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, MD, he makes sure everyone he comes in contact with remembers to be unreasonable in their pursuit of dreams, bringing to life the words of G.B. Shaw, “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.”
