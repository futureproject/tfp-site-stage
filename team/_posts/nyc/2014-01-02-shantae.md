As the Dream Director at Cardozo Senior High School in Washington, DC, Shantae is making sure she knows every face and every name in the school. Thatâ€™s because she knows that in order to build a new sense of community, you have to understand all of the individuals in it. She and her team are using social media campaigns, storytelling, and a lot more to reveal the great things that no one knew before about Cardozo and the people who go there.
