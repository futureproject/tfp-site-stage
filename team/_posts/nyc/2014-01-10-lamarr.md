A proud son of Omaha, Nebraska, Lamarr brings his experience as a motivational speaker to work, instilling in his students a passion for leadership. He’s built his life around listening, inspiring, and sharing with young people around the country the things he’s learned. And he’s taken that passion into The College Academy, in the Washington Heights neighborhood of NYC, as its Dream Director.
