Joyce’s approach to Dream Directing draws heavily on her experience as a kid who decided that she didn’t have a learning disability, but just a unique and different set of talents. It's led her to see the gifts that all young people possess, and made her passionate about bringing those gifts out. That belief led her first to working with incarcerated youth at Rikers Island, and now to to her ultimate dream job, at the Richard R. Green High School of Teaching in NYC.
