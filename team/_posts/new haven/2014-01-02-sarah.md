Before joining The Future Project, Sarah was building classrooms out of Eco-Bottles and trash as a Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala. That kind of brilliance and resourcefulness comes in handy as she manages our communication and engagement with the broad TFP community, gathering information and keeping them updated and informed about the latest happenings in our schools and on our team.  Based in New Haven, CT, she also works on the partnerships with community organizations and with the city.
