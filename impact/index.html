  <p>
    When we talk about students living lives of passion and purpose decades after their Future Project experience, we mean it; we're obsessed with sustainable inspiration. That's why we worked with our team of academic advisors to understand how to measure what sometimes can seem immeasurable.
  </p>
  <p>
  After three years of reseach, three categories of metrics rose to the top: the mindset to dream up a better future (<b>will</b>); the tangible abilities necessary to make that future real (<b>skill</b>); and the immersion in a school climate that helps make that ideal future seem possible (<b>thrill</b>). Obviously, we're thrilled that this framework rhymes. But we're even more excited that it reflects what a growing chorus of educators, experts — and students themselves! — are saying matters most in the 21st Century.
