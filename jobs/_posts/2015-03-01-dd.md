A Dream Director is a transformational leader, embedded into an American high school, committed to unleashing the passion and purpose of everyone in it. It’s a new job for a new century. A good Dream Director must be imaginative and practical—an entrepreneur, coach, educator, organizer, coalition-builder and most of all leader who can inspire students to identify what matters to them, and take action.
