We designed the new role of the Dream Director over the past two years in concert with thousands of students, teachers, principals, academics, and social entrepreneurs across America—and we solidified it by holding sacred a simple principle: that human values belong at the center of a school—and, more broadly, American education.

Dream Directors are embedded full-time in one school, which they work in tandem with the community from the start to reimagine as a place of possibility and action—one of our principals even renamed his school Possibility High—and with hundreds of students and faculty members to help them to see what brings them alive and then start to take action toward that. They provide high-dosage coaching and hundred-person workshops. They are constantly supporting students in small groups and in one-on-one to launch their dreams. They train faculty. They recruit dozens of volunteer coaches. And they collaborate day after day with their principal to transform culture, space, and policy.
 
But while dedicated to a school, a Dream Director has a broader responsibility: to American society. We live in a time where people are all too often beginning to doubt whether American public high schools will ever work—and, with it, whether or not a whole generation of young people with undiscovered genius will leave school lost and aimless in their search for meaning and success. We reject that argument. We believe that the people within schools, from students to teachers to custodians to principals, are ready to do extraordinary things—but need a catalytic leader to give them the training, mentorship, and spark to let it out. The Dream Director stands for the possibility of all people, and they step up daily to the steep but urgent challenge of reimagining the status quo.

The results of this work takes many inspiring forms, from student Future Projects—campaigns, organizations, products, events, and so much more—to physically redesigned schools and entirely new classes at the school. Students gain the will to succeed and the skills to lead. Schools become thrilling. New connections are formed within a school and across a community. Ripples of hope are sent forth from classrooms to community to city. And a new model for American education is born.

If you believe anything is possible, then you may be a Dream Director. We imagine Dream Directors one day in every school in America. Apply now to be one of the first.
