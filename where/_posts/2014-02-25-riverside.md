The Riverside Academy is a magnet high school, drawing students from around the greater New Haven area. Before it was a magnet, Riverside served as a transitional school for students who needed extra support because of situations outside of school. Because of that, the Dream Team, with the leadership of Dream Director George Black and Principal Wanda Gibbs, are beginning a conversation among young people in New Haven to redefine Riversideâ€™s identity in the community, to show the community that the school is a place of inspiration, excellence, and opportunity.
