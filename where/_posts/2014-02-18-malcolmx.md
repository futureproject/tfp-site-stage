Malcolm X. Shabazz High School has undergone a renaissance of sorts over the past few years. Formerly one of the lowest-performing and most violent schools not just in the City of Newark but in the entire State of New Jersey. When Principal Gemar Mills took the reins, he began to restore a sense of security, calm and opportunity to the school. Dream Director Divine Bradley and his Dream Team have been working closely with Principal Mills on school-wide events and extensive outreach to organizations in Newark to transform Shabazz, and build it as the nexus for their goal of “turning Brick City into Dream City.”
