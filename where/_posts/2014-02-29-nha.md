New Haven Academy is a small, innovative magnet high school and a leading high school in the New Haven Public Schools system. The school is active with the Facing History curriculum, giving students the chance to reflect on issues of social justice. The imperative to think critically, act responsibly and get involved in the community is one that Dream Director Laura Winnick and her Dream Team actively lead within the school, launching a school-wide campaign and programming during advisory periods.
