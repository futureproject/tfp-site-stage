The Henry Street School for International Studies is a small school on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Dream Director Maritza Alarcon, who herself keeps a dream list, has been using her experiences in jobs as varied as marketing and youth programming to bring a spirit of entrepreneurship to Henry Street, and to equip the students and teachers throughout the building (which includes other schools) with the tools and confidence to build entrepreneurial projects of their own.
