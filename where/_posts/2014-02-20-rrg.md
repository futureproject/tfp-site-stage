The Richard R. Green High School of Teaching was the first school, three years ago, that said yes to The Future Project. Dream Director Joyce Gendler is running “Dream Starter” sessions during advisory periods, where she and her Dream Team train other students to launch passion-based projects. Her Dream Team is also tackling multiple year-long initiatives, working closely with the administration and faculty on professional development, and creating weekly school-wide programming.
