Wilbur Cross is one of two comprehensive public high schools in the City of New Haven, and one of the biggest schools we work in. Given its size, Dream Director Frank Brady knows he has to go big, and is doing just that with strong arts and performance initiatives, and regular large scale school-wide events.
