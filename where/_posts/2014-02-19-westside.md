West Side High School, founded in 1925, has mirrored in itself the changes that have happened to the City of Newark since the middle of the 20th century. When the school, and Principal Arlene Manning, asked The Future Project to work with them, we jumped at the opportunity, both because we knew the impact we could have, but also because of the historical importance of the school to the story of education in Newark. Deputy Dream Directors Zaki Smith and Carlos Walton are taking their own stories, and teaching the students at West Side how the skills, mentalities and experiences theyâ€™ve learned on the streets can be applied toward entrepreneurial ends.
