“Miss Shantae J.,” as the students at Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus call her, is the Dream Director at our launch high school in DC. She wanted to be a cop and detective when she was a kid. Not because she wanted to bring bad guys to justice, but because she wanted to drive around in “a really cool car that was unmarked.”

That didn’t work out, but what she’s doing now is just as cool—cruising around the school in her trademark blazer and flashy blue buttons, talking to students and making them realize their own possibility.
