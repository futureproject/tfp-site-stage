Eastern Senior High School calls itself “The Pride of Capitol Hill,” and it’s not hard to see why. A few years ago, the school was phased out, and re-opened under new leadership. And despite the changes, the teachers, alumni, staff and students all retained a deep pride in their school. Dream Director Voncia Barno Monchais and her Dream Team, who demonstrate their leadership by working with the administration to design solutions to some tough challenges, are uncovering new Rambler pride, and giving students new ways to express and channel it.
