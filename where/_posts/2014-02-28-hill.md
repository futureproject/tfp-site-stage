Hill Regional Career High School is a magnet high school that draws students from all across the greater New Haven area. With a bent toward business and technology, the school nonetheless encourages creativity and artistic expression. It’s that spirit that Dream Director Eve King is bringing out, and which she’s using to forge connections with other high schools in New Haven, to create a real community of young dreamers.
