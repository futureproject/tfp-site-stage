Leadership Institute is a small school that’s packing a big punch. Dream Director Kleaver Cruz, who was raised in the Bronx, is working with his Dream Team to empower students to grow as leaders—partnering with local organizations to bring resources to the school, and working with students’ families to make sure that the support for their passion in school continues once they leave.
