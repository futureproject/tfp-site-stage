High School in the Community is a unique partnership between the teachers and the school district, in which the teachers themselves run the school. Knowing that the school was designed as a place not just in the community, but for it, Dream Director Christian Shaboo is bringing alumni back to the school as Deputy Dream Directors to support current students, and reimagining the school as an art gallery that invites the community in.
